    "Airbnb is a short term rental marketplace that connects people looking for short term stays with property owners who are willing to have them. Owners post details of their property such as photos, specifications, and rules. A user will register onto the platform by sharing their personal and payment information with Airbnb. Once registered, users can look for a place they like, and once they find it, they will book for a specific date and pay. "
